# AS-APA4-CB-CMK

***AS-APA4-CB-CMK*** is a Fontys Advanced Computer Science Module based on mathematical and applied logic ressources.

## Courses

This module has different courses:

- MATH3 / MATH2 / MATH1
- APL or Applied Logic

### MATH Lectures

Math lectures are set, logic and basic mathematic knowledge courses. There is no ressource of those courses here.

### Applied Logic

Applied Logic is a course about using the knowledge from Math courses on logic inside code.

Here, we're using SMT-LIB with a Theorem Prover called [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). Z3 is a Theorem Prover, developed by Microsoft.

In that course, you will need to solve problems using boolean logic operations.

You will find the ressource related to this course [here](./APL/).
