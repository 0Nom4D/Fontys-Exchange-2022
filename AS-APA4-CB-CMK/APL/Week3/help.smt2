;; Run with: z3 sudoku.smt2

;; This file is structured as follows:
;; 1. Sets up the data types and helper functions.
;; 2. Assertions are made to define what a valid Sudoku solution is.
;; 3. An example board is given, though only some numbers are filled in!
;; 4. This leaves the SMT solver Z3 with the task of filling in the blanks.
;;    This is done with (check-sat), and then the board content is printed.

;; Technically this should be here for the use of (get-value) at the end.
