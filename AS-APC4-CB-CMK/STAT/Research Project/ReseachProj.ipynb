    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This research project has been done between August 31st and the October 3rd 2022. We were asked to complete a research on the thematic of our choice. Having no idea what to work on, we choose a simple situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "France and Netherlands both have a long periods of rain and we just discovered the city centre where there is shops and restaurants. What if we study the impact of weather on the shopping behaviour of people of Eindhoven?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose that thematic and we worked on it during this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first task, we created 2 hypothesis, our null Hypothesis called H0 and our alternative hypothesis called HA, in order to begin our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis, H0 and HA, were respectively the followings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- People shop wether it rains or it is sunny.\n",
    "- People shop less when it rains than when it is sunny.\n",
    "\n",
    "In first place, we wanted to measure the number of people in the street in a street where there are shops and restaurants. The problem with that would have been the number of data points, which would have been too large. We restraints ourselves to focus on specific areas of this street by looking at shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this research, we had to take a place in Eindhoven when there are shops and restaurants. Therefore, we choose the city centre. We exactly choose the Demerstraat, Eindhoven, where are located a lot of clothing stores and restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also had to choose well frequented shops. We choose one clothing store and one restaurant or fast food, both being attractive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could choose Levis but the prices are very high so we decided to choose \"The Athlete's Foot\" located at Demer 18B, 5611 AR, Eindhoven.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get data during the day or the afternoon, we choose a restaurant where people can take food they can eat on the go. Therefore, we took Baker's Bart, located at Demer 21, 5611 AN, Eindhoven.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two locations also have an advantage: we can look at both stores being at the same location so we can communicate while taking data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point, we chose the simple randome sample sampling method. We took random people entering the shops regardless of age, sex or nationality.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also had to choose a time where there are people shopping. Then, we took the an afternoon time, which was between 3:40 PM and 4:30 PM. We also choose 2 days when we were available and when people were shopping. We took Monday and Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we knew what to do: Counting people entering \"The Athlete's Foot\" and \"Baker's Bart\" on Monday and Thursday between 3:40PM and 4:30PM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sample\n",
    "\n",
    "With this Notebook, you will find our [dataset as a CSV file](./fdata.csv). All date points are in UTC date format.\n",
    "\n",
