# AS-APC4-CB-CMK

***AS-APC4-CB-CMK*** is a Fontys Advanced Computer Science Module based on statistical knowledge.

## Courses

This module has different courses:

- STAT or Statistics
- DETH or Decision Theory

### STAT

STAT is a course based on basic statistical knowledge and concepts.

You'll learn how to use statistical data and how to understand that data.

During that course, you'll have a make a research project on the subject of your choice, get data and use statistical tests on it to prove your hypothesis.

You will find the ressource related to that course [here](./STAT/).

### DETH

DETH is a course based on Decision Theories (I think that's really exhaustive).

During this course, you will have to apply the knowledge you receive to develop/design a reforcement learning model.

The project in the DETH folder isn't a Reinforced Learning model but we managed with the teacher and every went fine.

You will find the ressource related to this course [here](./DETH/).
