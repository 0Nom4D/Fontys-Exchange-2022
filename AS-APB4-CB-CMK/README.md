# AS-APB4-CB-CMK

***AS-APB4-CB-CMK*** is a Fontys Advanced Computer Science Module based on algorithm, parsers, lexers and interpretors knowledge.

## Courses

This module has different courses:

- ALG1
- ALG2
- AUT

### ALG1

ALG1 is the first course of that module based on really simple knowledge about algorithms.

Each week, assignments are due and are based on some tiny problems.

You will find the ressource related to this course [here](./ALG1/).

### ALG2

ALG2 is another course of that module based on more advanced knowledge about algorithms.

ALG2 is more about NP-completeness problems knowledge.

Each week, assignments are due and are based on some tiny problems.

A programming assignment, that can be done in any language, is also mandatory.

You will find the ressource related to this course [here](./ALG2/) (only the project).

### AUT

AUT is a course based on parsers, lexers and interpretors in Java.

You will need to use Java feat ANTLR.

Each week assignment is completed by the next weeks assignments, making that course really progressive.

You will find the ressource related to this course [here](./AUT/).
