# AS-APD4-CB-CMK

***AS-APD4-CB-CMK*** is a Fontys Advanced Computer Science Module based on development skills and data science.

## Courses

This module has different courses:

- Functional Programing
- Data Science
- Synchronisation

### Functional Programing

Functional Programing objective is to learn functional programing with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

Each week, you need to make assignments in order to prove you're learning something from the course.

A research project on any language is available. You need to prove how much the language you choose in functional.

You will find the ressource related to this course [here](./FP/).

### Data Science

Data Science is a course based on Machine Learning and Data Analysis.

Its goal is to learn how to analyse data and how to create machine learning models based on those datas.

In 2022, the main goal was to analyse the results of old international football games in order to create a Machine Learning model able to predict the winner of the next World Cup in Qatar.
